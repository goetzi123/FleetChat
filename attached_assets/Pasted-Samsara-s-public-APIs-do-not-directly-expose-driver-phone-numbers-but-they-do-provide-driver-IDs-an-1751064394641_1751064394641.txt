Samsara’s public APIs do not directly expose driver phone numbers, but they do provide driver IDs and associated metadata. Here's a breakdown:

1. Driver IDs
Yes — Samsara’s API exposes driver IDs through endpoints like:

GET /fleet/drivers: Lists drivers with unique id, name, and other profile metadata.
2. Phone Numbers
No — phone numbers are not included in the standard API responses. While Samsara internally stores phone numbers (for driver app usage, text alerts, etc.), this data is considered sensitive and private, and:

Not exposed in the default API response
May require special permissions or support from Samsara if your use case (e.g., WhatsApp integration) demands it
Alternative Options:
You can associate a driver ID with custom fields, like phone number, via a back-end CRM or fleet management system.
Driver phone numbers may be manually uploaded or managed through the Samsara dashboard, but they are not API-accessible by default.
If you’re doing an integration (e.g., sending WhatsApp messages), you’ll need to store the mapping of driver ID ↔ phone number yourself.

Yes — Samsara does store and expose driver phone numbers via its Drivers API, but only under the right permissions and conditions.

🧩 How it works

The Drivers endpoint (GET /fleet/drivers or GET /fleet/drivers/{id}) returns driver metadata including basic information such as name, phone number, and license

.
Your API token must include these scopes:
Read Drivers
Read Driver App Settings, which is often required to surface phone numbers

.
So if your org has phone numbers saved in Samsara, and you've granted those permissions in your token, then doing something like:

GET /fleet/drivers/{driverId}
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-with-scopes>
should return a phone field in the driver object.

✅ Workaround / Checklist

Ensure your Samsara Users have phone numbers entered via Dashboard → Drivers → Settings → Phone Number

Create or update your API token to include:
Read Drivers
Read Driver App Settings

.
Call the API endpoint and inspect the JSON for "phone": "+1234567890".
If phone numbers still don't appear

Confirm they’re saved in Dashboard.
Verify your token’s scope includes Read Driver App Settings.
Contact Samsara Support (via dashboard’s “Get help” → “Contact Support”) to check if your organization has any privacy flags preventing phone number exposure

📌 TL;DR
Yes — there is a supported way: just ensure phone numbers are filled in the dashboard and that your API token carries the Read Drivers + Read Driver App Settings scopes. That will allow the driver object to include phone.
