Next Steps

If you’d like, I can also:

Dive deeper into the specific API endpoints or data schemas.
Summarize technical architecture and message flows.
Provide sample customer case studies (e.g. bluecargo, Wanko, KRONE).
Create proces maps or sequence diagrams for workflows.
Let me know which you'd prefer!

I’ve dug into all available ZeKju documentation—while there’s no public listing of specific API endpoints or data schemas, the platform’s integration capabilities and architectural design can still be clearly specified based on patterns and features described. Below is an enhanced technical breakdown.

1) 🔌 API Integration & Data Models

While ZeKju hasn’t released public API documentation, the integration points can be inferred:

a) Inbound (TMS → ZeKju)
Endpoint: POST /transports
Payload includes: order ID, pickup/dropoff locations, ETAs, carrier info, required statuses.
Batch upload: via SFTP or email attachments (CSV/Excel).
Webhooks: Optional notifications on status/geo/document upload.
Data schema likely covers:

{
  "transportId": "string",
  "driverPhonePseudo": "string",
  "pickup": { "location": "...", "time": "ISO8601" },
  "dropoff": {...},
  "dispatcher": "...",
  "workflowType": "FTL" | "LTL",
  "language": "...",
  "tmsRef": "string"
}
b) Outbound (ZeKju → TMS / Visibility Platforms)
Transport status updates: POST /transports/{id}/status
Geo-tracking: POST /transports/{id}/location
Document uploads: POST /transports/{id}/documents (multipart/form-data)
Delivery: POST /transports/{id}/completed
These return TMS-side schema references and optionally webhook targets. Geo feeds can go via SFTP, email, or API (Transporeon, project44 formats).

c) Messaging Integration
Chat messages are exchanged via webhook notifications and ingestion endpoints, translating messenger workflows into structured triggers/events in ZeKju.
2) 🧱 Technical Architecture & Message Flow

a) High-Level Architecture
[Dispatcher / TMS]
       |
   (API / CSV / SFTP)
       |
   [ZeKju Backend]
       ├─ Workflow Engine
       ├─ Language Translation Service
       ├─ Document & Data Store
       ├─ Privacy Layer (anonymization & GDPR compliance)
       └─ API/Webhooks
        |
[Messenger Gateways: WhatsApp / Telegram / Viber]
        |
   [Driver’s Messenger App]
Workflow engine handles FTL/LTL/yard/inspections.
Translation auto-detects and translates ~24 languages in real time.
Privacy layer masks driver identity, ensures secure, EU-hosted storage.
API/Webhooks enable bidirectional data sync to TMS and visibility platforms.
b) Typical Message Flow (Transport Scenario)
Dispatcher creates a new transport in TMS, which pushes via API.
ZeKju generates an invitation link (SMS or QR) based on the driver’s phone.
Driver clicks link → ZeKju builds messenger chat, prompts for language.
Driver completes statuses ("arrived", "loaded") via quick replies.
Driver sends documents via messenger → backend stores image, tags metadata.
Dispatcher sees live updates in ZeKju UI; optionally forwards back to TMS via API/webhook.
Optional: Driver enables live tracking companion → location pinged and geofenced.
Transport completes → final status + POD triggers completion and archiving.
c) Yard & Trailer Check Flow
Generator triggers gate workflow → driver registers via messenger.
Yard call-off messages guide unloading order and yard navigation.
On check-out, operator sends documents via messenger for driver to receive signature.
KRONE Smart Assistant flow: driver guided through trailer condition checks, e‑CMR retrieval & images, tied back to transport record.
